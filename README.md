## My process

I started by first defining the variables on the document root and resetting the default styles. I was aiming for a semantic mark-up and then I added styles accordingly. I have used 'rem' sizing throughout and also accounted for 2 smaller screen-sizes, thereby keeping the component responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
